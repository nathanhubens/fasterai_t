# Fasterai
> Create smaller and faster networks with fastai


Fasterai is a library built to be used with fastai, implementing recent research on neural network compression

Neural Network compression can come in many ways:
- Pruning
- Knowledge Distillation
- Quantization
- Low-Rank Approximation
- Batch Normalization Folding
- ...

## Install

`pip install your_project_name`

## How to use

### Pruning

### Batch Normalization Folding

### Knowledge Distillation
